**Objective**

The goal was to provide a concise view of what customers are saying online on social media and Forums, identify key pain points in the sell-side process, and evaluate our resolution effectiveness.


**Approach**

I focused on major platforms like Google, X (Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, Quora, and Reddit. I created and analyzed dummy data (136 customer mentions) for the past month (December 2025) inspired by common real complaints (rude inspectors if sellers decline paid add-ons, low pricing given to sellers as compared to what is offered to buyers on the platform, delay in final payment or RC transfer, etc.).
Dashboard built in Power Bi for easy visuals!

Key snapshot of the dataset include:

_Total mentions_: 136 (121 Unique and 15 Duplicate)

_Sentiment Breakdown_: Positive 15% (18), Neutral 31% (38), Negative 54% (65)

_Top Pain Points_: Valuation issues (28 tickets), Payment Delay (14 tickets), Inspection/Rude Behavior (13 tickets)

_Resolution Metrics_: Winback at 58% below the target goal (80%), TAT 3.43 days strong above goal, CSAT 4.31 slightly above the target, and Unresolved Tickets are 18%.

_Platforms_: Google (31%), X (24%), and Quora (14%) are the Top 3 negative drivers whereas Instagram has more positive.

Sellers are angry and frustrated with the unfair pricing and process hassles which is the top most reason for CARS24's negative reputation. It is still time and we are quick to respond to these negative perceptions of people.


**Key Insights**

This dashboard pulls together customer reviews into an easy-to-interpret view. Here’s how it help:

_Overall Sentiment Breakdown_: Out of 136 total mentions, 15 mentions are duplicates and after removing it, negatives dominate at 65, neutrals at 38, and positives at only 18. This tells customers are mostly unhappy or dissatisfied about their experience selling their cars with us and compare it with other applications, specially “Spinny.”

_Platform Hotspots_: Google leads with 31% of mentions, followed by X at 24%, Quora 14%, Reddit at 13%, Facebook at 12%, and the rest is on Instagram. Sentiments vary by platform like, negatives are high on Reddit and X while Google has a mix but still bend towards negative. ****

_Pain Points Driving Negatives_: The biggest complaints are about Valuation (26 negative mentions out of total ticket count 28 including duplicates), Payment Delays (12 mentions out of total 14), Inspection/Rude Behavior (12 mentions out of 13 tickets), and Others (like general delays). 

_Daily Trends_: The line chart for daily breakdown of December 2025 shows ups and downs, starting low around December 1-5, dipping in mid-month, then spiking towards the end up to around 10-15 mentions per day. 

_Resolution Effectiveness_: We created tickets for negatives and resolved 82% with a winback at 58.33%, meaning we got about 58% of unhappy customers delete posts or add positives. However, that’s below the average goal of 80%. CSAT is solid at 4.31 beating the goal and TAT is also better than the goal with 3.43 days. 

These visuals make it clear to spot where the noise is coming from!


**Key Findings**

Over half the mentions are negative which suggests our sell-side process has some rough edges that dissatisfies customers, leading to public complaints.

Valuation is the top pain point till now with high mentions and tickets which is possibly because sellers might feel undervalued.

We are quick on TAT and good on CSAT but lagging with the winback. There are 18% unresolved tickets, might be because issues are trickier or customers' trust is all gone.

Forums like Quora and Reddit have more negative discussions while Google has neutral mentions. Positives are low everywhere!

If we combine pain points with platforms, valuation complaints spike on Reddit reviews while behavior issues pop on Quora.

The dummy data assumes a mid-sized volume (136 mentions), with negatives skewed high based on real complaints I researched.


**Improvements**

We’re doing well on CSAT and TAT but there’s clear opportunity to lift other aspects to positive too, including:

_Target Valuation_: Prioritize valuation transparency maybe by adding an online estimator tool that can bring back the trust of the customers that they are not undervalued.

_Boost Winback_: Since winback is less than the goal, adding follow-ups, surveying why customers don’t respond, and little incentives for positive updates can be a good opportunity.

_Encourage Positives_: Motivating happy sellers to post via social media or give a review in return for some points can also uplift the negative reputation. Create more seller success testimonials or reels for social media to counterbalance.

_Broader Monitoring_: Expand to more forums and flag duplicates to avoid double-counting efforts as well as negative mentions.

_Train Inspectors_: For inspection/rude behaviors, train inspectors on soft skills and try to get feedback from the sellers.
